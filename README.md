## Single Virtual Machine Based Installation for Laptops and Desktops

### Description

This repository contains instructions, configuration, and code for the implementation of three common platforms used for constructing an event-based architecture for exploring IoT concepts.

### Base Materials

* Any modern laptop or desktop with the capability to run a Virtual Machine Hypervisor such as VirtualBox
* The Oracle VirtualBox hypervisor from www.virtualbox.org
* Ubuntu Server v20.04 (or 18.04) from https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/
* For a full experience a Raspberry Pi is also needed.  
* For an even more full experience an Arduino Uno (or other Arduino - a Pro Micro or Mega would work as well)
